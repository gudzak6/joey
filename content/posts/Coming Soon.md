Engagement for voyager:

Level 1: Core action
- What matters is not the growth of users but the growth of users completing the core action. The core action is what forms the foundation of your product, some examples include:
	Facebook ->  Friending
	Snapchat ->  Snapping 
	Pinterest  ->  Pinning
	Voyager ->    Recurring Buys

Level 2: Retaining users
- Product needs to get better the more it’s used. Users have more to lose by leaving the product. How do you get those users to stick? 

Focus should be on Creating accruing benefits and mounting losses as a user engages. As a consumer adds data to the product, voyager needs to use this data to improve the experience. To mount loss, the longer you stay the more you depend on the product and accrued value of some sort. 

With the core action of recurring buys, the more you save, the more money you will make from interest. By leaving, you mount the loss of losing the amount of potential money in interest gained. 

Let’s say for example you invested 10,000 into USDC:
- Buy $10,000 USDC
- Interest rate of 8.5%
- After one year you will have gained interest of $850 with a new balance of 10,850 
- With recurring buys of 100 a month you’ll earn $896.06 a year plus your investment totatling 12,096.06. 

Level 3: The virtuous loop created:
Users set up recurring buys -> gain interest -> More money gained
